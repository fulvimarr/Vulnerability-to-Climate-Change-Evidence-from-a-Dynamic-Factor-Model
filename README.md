# Vulnerability to Climate Change: Evidence from a Dynamic Factor Model
<b>Fulvia Marotta and Haroon Mumtaz</b>



We construct country-year-specific indicators of vulnerability to global warming using a dynamic factor model with stochastic volatility. The model allows us to: 1)  quantify the extent of the increase in global temperatures, 2) offers a unique measure of how each countryâ€™s temperatures align with this common global movement. The model is estimated with Bayesian techniques for a sample of 141 countries between 1923 and 2020.

The data on the contribution of the temperature world factor to the country-specific temperature volatility is available [HERE](contr_w_factor.xlsx).
