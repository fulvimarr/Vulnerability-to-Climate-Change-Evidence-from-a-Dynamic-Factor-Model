# Vulnerability-to-Climate-Change-Evidence-from-a-Dynamic-Factor-Model
We construct country-year-specific indicators of vulnerability to global warming using a dynamic factor model with stochastic volatility. The model allows us to: 1)  quantify the extent of the increase in global temperatures, 2) offers a unique measure of how each countryâ€™s temperatures align with this common global movement. The model is estimated with Bayesian techniques for a sample of 141 countries between 1923 and 2020.
